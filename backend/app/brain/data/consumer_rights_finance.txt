CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT, 2019 - FINANCIAL SERVICES RIGHTS

1. Right to Safety
Consumers have the right to be protected against the marketing of goods and services which are hazardous to life and property. In finance, this applies to mis-selling of risky products (like complex derivatives) to uninformed retail investors.

2. Right to Information
Consumers have the right to be informed about the quality, quantity, potency, purity, standard and price of services so as to protect the consumer against unfair trade practices.
- Banks must disclose all hidden charges, penal interest rates, and terms of service clearly.
- "Free" services that actually have costs violate this right.

3. Definition of Defocinecy in Service
Any fault, imperfection, shortcoming or inadequacy in the quality, nature and manner of performance which is required to be maintained by or under any law.
Examples in Banking:
- Unauthorized debit not reversed within timelines.
- Failure to close account despite request.
- Loss of pledged jewelry/documents.

4. Unfair Trade Practices
(a) Making false or misleading representation concerning the services.
(b) Refusing to accept early repayment of loans where allowed by law.
(c) Withholding information about the financial status of the service provider if relevant (e.g., impending bankruptcy).

5. Liability of Endorsers
Celebrities or influencers endorsing financial products (like crypto exchanges or loan apps) can be held liable if the product claims are found to be false or misleading, and they have not done due diligence.
